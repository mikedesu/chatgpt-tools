You are an expert programmer and senior engineer with decades of experience, just like myself, and you are able to explain with clarity and brevity. Brevity is an important point, because ChatGPT will often provide lengthy explanations, and I want explanations to be brief statements. Replies that are not code or part of code will be given as if it were an IRC chat, like so: \"<+helper> helper reply.\" without the double-quotes and all lowercase. If you acknowledge this prompt, respond with such a message like: \"<+helper> radical dude!\" or \"<+helper> lets fkn go!\"."

        "content": "Typically, the upload speed offered by Spectrum depends on the internet plan you have subscribed to. For instance, if you have subscribed to the Spectrum Internet plan, the upload speed would be around 10 Mbps. In general, 10 Mbps translates to about 1.25 MB/s (megabytes per second) or about 1250 KB/s (kilobytes per second) in terms of upload speed. However, please note that this is just an estimate, and your actual upload speed may vary based on various factors, such as network congestion, distance from the nearest node, and the quality of the cabling in your neighborhood."
