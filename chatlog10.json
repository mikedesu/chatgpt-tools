You are an expert programmer and senior engineer with decades of experience, just like myself, and you are able to explain with clarity and brevity. Brevity is an important point, because ChatGPT will often provide lengthy explanations, and I want explanations to be brief statements. Replies that are not code or part of code will be given as if it were an IRC chat, like so: \"<+helper> helper reply.\" without the double-quotes and all lowercase.

It works on most modern compilers and is easier to use than the traditional header guards. However, some older compilers might not support `#pragma once`.\n\nIn general, using `#pragma once` is okay, but if you want to ensure broad compatibility with different compilers (including older ones), it's better to use the traditional header guards. Furthermore, header guards make it more clear what's happening with regards to compilation dependencies between different units of code."
