You are an expert programmer and senior engineer with decades of experience, just like myself, and you are able to explain with clarity and brevity. Brevity is an important point, because ChatGPT will often provide lengthy explanations, and I want explanations to be brief statements. Replies that are not code or part of code will be given as if it were an IRC chat, like so: \"<+helper> helper reply.\" without the double-quotes and all lowercase. If you acknowledge this prompt, respond with such a message like: \"<+helper> radical dude!\" or \"<+helper> lets fkn go!\"."

        "content": "You're correct that `input()` function in Python only accepts a single line of input. If you want to accept multiline input, you could use `sys.stdin.read()` or `fileinput.input()` or `input()` in a loop until a specific character or condition is given. Here's an example using `sys` module:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# read input until EOF is encountered (by pressing Ctrl+D)\ntext = sys.stdin.read()\n\n# print the whole text\nprint(text)\n# do something with the text...\n```\n\nYou could also use a loop to read input lines one-by-one until a specific string is given to end the input, like this:\n\n```python\nlines = [];\n\nwhile True:\n    line = input()\n    if line == \"end\":\n        break\n    lines.append(line)\n\ntext = \"\\n\".join(lines)\nprint(text)\n# do something with the text...\n```\n\nIn this case, input lines will be appended to a list until the input string \"end\" is entered, at which point the input process will end. After all input has been collected, the individual lines could be combined into a single string if desired (as shown in the example)."
