- We should consider using network analysis tools like Wireshark for capturing and analyzing network traffic.
- Virtualization software such as VirtualBox or VMware to create and manage multiple virtual environments for testing.
- Reverse engineering tools like Radare2 for disassembling and analyzing binary files.
- A way to securely communicate and share findings, such as encrypted email or messaging platforms.
- Access to underground forums or communities where undisclosed vulnerabilities may be shared.
- Does this plan cover all necessary aspects for our hunt for zero-day vulnerabilities? Is there anything else we should consider?
