- Focus on widely used software like operating systems, web browsers, or popular applications.
- Use automated tools like fuzzers and static analysis tools to find vulnerabilities.
- Write modular Python code to exploit different types of vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, SQL injection).
- Set up a virtual machine or sandbox for testing to avoid legal issues.
- Document the exploit process and prepare a detailed report for the vendor.
