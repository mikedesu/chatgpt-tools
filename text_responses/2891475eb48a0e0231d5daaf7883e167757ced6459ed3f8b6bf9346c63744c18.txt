Let's finalize our plan by incorporating the additional steps into our outline:
1. Target specific versions of software, prioritizing recent releases for potential vulnerabilities.
2. Implement continuous scanning using AFL or libFuzzer for fuzzing and SonarQube for static analysis.
3. Develop exploit code with concise comments for easy modification across various scenarios.
4. Set up the testing environment using tools like QEMU or VirtualBox for efficient testing.
5. Create a template for the disclosure report containing vulnerability specifics, exploit code, and mitigation recommendations.
