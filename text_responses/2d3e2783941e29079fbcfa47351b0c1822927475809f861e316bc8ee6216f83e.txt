- We need to gather essential tools like disassemblers (e.g., IDA Pro), debuggers (e.g., GDB), and fuzzers (e.g., AFL).
- We should also have access to various operating systems and software versions to test against.
- A secure environment for testing and analyzing potential vulnerabilities is crucial.
- We'll need a repository of known vulnerabilities to avoid duplicating efforts and to learn from.
- Scripting tools like Python for automation and exploitation are necessary.
- Do you have any specific tools or resources in mind that we might be missing?
