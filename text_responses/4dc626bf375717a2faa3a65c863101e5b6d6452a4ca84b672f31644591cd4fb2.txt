Great suggestions for our plan. Let's combine them into a cohesive outline:
1. Target widely used software such as operating systems, web browsers, or popular applications.
2. Utilize automated tools like fuzzers and static analysis tools to discover vulnerabilities.
3. Develop modular Python code to exploit various vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and SQL injection.
4. Create a virtual machine or sandbox environment for safe testing to avoid legal complications.
5. Document the exploit process thoroughly and prepare a detailed report for responsible disclosure to the software vendor.
