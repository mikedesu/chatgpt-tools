Hackers exploit remote code execution vulnerabilities by injecting and executing malicious code on a target system, often through methods like buffer overflows, deserialization flaws, or command injection. Developers can prevent these attacks by using safe programming languages, implementing input validation and sanitization, regularly updating software, and employing security measures like sandboxing and least privilege access.
