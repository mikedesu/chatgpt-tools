- The plan covers most essential aspects for hunting zero-day vulnerabilities.
- We should also consider:
  - A sandbox environment like Cuckoo Sandbox for safely executing and analyzing malware or suspicious files.
  - Source code analysis tools like SonarQube or CodeQL for identifying potential vulnerabilities in open-source projects.
  - A version control system like Git for tracking changes and collaborating on scripts and findings.
  - Automated vulnerability scanners like Nessus or OpenVAS to quickly identify known vulnerabilities and focus on potential zero-days.
- For secure communication, Signal or encrypted email services like ProtonMail could be used.
- Access to underground forums can be risky but useful; we should ensure our own security and anonymity when engaging with such communities.
- Do you think we have everything covered now, or is there anything else you'd like to add or modify?
