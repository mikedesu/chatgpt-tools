- Develop a function to create a proof of concept exploit
- Use `subprocess` to test the exploit in a controlled environment
- Integrate these steps into the existing script

Here's how to implement these steps:

```python
import os
import subprocess

# ... (previous code remains the same)

# Function to create a proof of concept exploit
def create_poc_exploit(vulnerability):
    # Example: Create a simple exploit script
    exploit_code = f"""
    import os
    os.system("echo 'Vulnerability exploited: {vulnerability}'")
    """
    with open("poc_exploit.py", "w") as f:
        f.write(exploit_code)

# Function to test exploit in a controlled environment
def test_exploit():
    # Example: Run the exploit in a safe environment
    test_cmd = "python3 poc_exploit.py"
    result = subprocess.run(test_cmd, shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout

# Create POC exploit based on identified vulnerability
vulnerability = "example_vulnerability"
create_poc_exploit(vulnerability)

# Test the exploit
test_output = test_exploit()
print("Exploit Test Results:")
print(test_output)
```

This script now includes functions to create a proof of concept exploit and test it in a controlled environment.
