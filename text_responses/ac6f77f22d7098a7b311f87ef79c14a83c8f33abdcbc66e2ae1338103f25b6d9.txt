Buffer overflow attacks exploit software vulnerabilities by overwriting memory beyond a buffer's boundary, potentially allowing malicious code execution; developers can mitigate this by using safe functions, implementing address space layout randomization (ASLR), enabling data execution prevention (DEP), and performing regular code audits and static analysis to identify and fix buffer-related issues.
