Attackers exploit XML injection by injecting malicious XML code to manipulate data or execute unintended operations, often through techniques like XPath injection or XML entity expansion. Developers can protect against XML injection by validating and sanitizing all XML inputs, using parameterized queries for XML operations, and implementing proper input validation to prevent malicious XML constructs.
