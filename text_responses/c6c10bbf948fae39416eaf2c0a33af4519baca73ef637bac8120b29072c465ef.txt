- Choose a widely used software or network system with a large user base
- Research recent vulnerabilities and zero-day exploits related to the chosen target
- Set up a testing environment to safely perform penetration testing and exploitation
- Use fuzzing techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities in the target system
- Develop a proof-of-concept exploit code to achieve remote code execution
